ARM ARITHMETIC AND LOGIC INSTRUCTIONS

flag setting instructions
ADDS - to update the status registers (N,Z,C,V) after adding
SUBS - to update the status registers (N,Z,C,V) after subtracting

N and V flags
N - negative result
V - signed overflow - when result is greater than 2^31 or less than -2^31

Z flag
result of an operation is set

C flag
If result is greater than 2^32.

Comparison Istructions
CMP - subtracts a register or immediate value from a register value and updates condition codes
CMN - adds a register or an immediate value to another register and updates the condition codes
TST - Test - logically ANDs an arithmetic value with a register value and 
	updates the conditon codes without affecting the V flag.
TEQ - Testing equivalence - logically exlusive ORs an arithmetic value with a register value and 
		updates the conditon codes without affecting the V flag.
MRS - Move PSR to general purpose register
MSR - Move general purpose register to PSR

N,Z,C,V flags are set(rest) by
 1. TST or CMP instructions
 2. ADDS, SUBS etc
 3. write directly to PSR
 4. 16-bit Thumb ALU instructions



Boolean Operations

1. MOVN - 2's complement (negative) of a number is moved. 
2. AND - logical AND (word)
3. ORR - logical OR (word)
4. EOR - exclusive OR (word)
5. BIC - bit clear - eg: BIC R1,R2,R3 (R1 = R2 AND NOT R3)
